# Configuration and Secrets (Effect v4)

Use this reference for runtime configuration, environment providers, test config, and credentials. Verify APIs against
the project's installed Effect v4 declarations.

Read runtime configuration through yieldable `Config` recipes and `ConfigProvider` layers—not `process.env` inside
service logic. Load config during implementing-layer construction so bad/missing config fails startup with Effect's
typed config error instead of surprising a later request.

```ts
import { Config, ConfigProvider, Effect, Layer, Redacted } from "effect";

const WidgetConfig = Config.all({
  apiKey: Config.redacted("WIDGET_API_KEY"),
  baseUrl: Config.url("WIDGET_API_BASE_URL"),
  timeoutMs: Config.number("WIDGET_TIMEOUT_MS").pipe(Config.withDefault(5_000)),
  model: Config.option(Config.string("WIDGET_MODEL")),
});

export const WidgetClientLive = Layer.effect(
  WidgetClient,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const config = yield* WidgetConfig;
    const http = yield* HttpClient.HttpClient;
    return makeWidgetClient({ http, config });
  }),
);
```

## Recipe chooser

- Scalars: `Config.string`, `number`, `boolean`, `url`.
- Secrets: `Config.redacted`.
- Structured/refined values: `Config.schema` or `Config.mapOrFail`.
- Semantic absence: `Config.option`.
- A default only when data is missing: `Config.withDefault`; malformed supplied data must still fail.
- Alternatives: `Config.orElse` only when intentionally accepting any first-recipe failure.
- Aggregate: `Config.all`.
- Library config helpers: `Config.Wrap<T>` + `Config.unwrap`.

Defaults should be safe and non-secret. Required production endpoints, credentials, tenant IDs, and destructive-mode
flags usually should not default. Parse once into domain-meaningful config rather than repeatedly reading strings.

## Provider wiring

The runtime's default provider reads environment variables. Replace/add providers at application/test composition:

- `ConfigProvider.layer(provider)` replaces the current provider.
- `ConfigProvider.layerAdd(provider)` adds a fallback; `{ asPrimary: true }` makes the added provider win.
- `ConfigProvider.fromUnknown(value)` creates deterministic test configuration.
- `ConfigProvider.fromEnv()` reads environment variables.
- `ConfigProvider.constantCase(provider)` maps names to screaming snake case.
- `ConfigProvider.nested(provider, prefix)` scopes a provider under a path.

```ts
const TestConfig = ConfigProvider.layer(
  ConfigProvider.fromUnknown({
    WIDGET_API_KEY: "test-only-key",
    WIDGET_API_BASE_URL: "https://widget.test",
    WIDGET_TIMEOUT_MS: 10,
  }),
);
```

Provide this layer at the real test seam with `Effect.provide`; do not mutate `process.env` between tests. If the app
already exposes a typed application-config service, ordinary service tests can `Layer.succeed` that service; reserve
provider tests for testing decoding/default behavior itself.

## Redacted end to end

Keep credentials `Redacted.Redacted<string>` through config objects, services, client factories, and method inputs.
Call `Redacted.value(secret)` only at the final adapter operation that requires plaintext (authorization header, SDK
constructor, signing function). Do not unwrap in a layer merely for convenience and retain the plaintext.

`Redacted` protects ordinary inspection/logging, but it is not encryption or an authorization boundary. Never:

- include plaintext secrets in tagged errors, log/span attributes, error-report metadata, metrics labels, cache keys, or URLs;
- interpolate them into error messages;
- serialize config objects containing unwrapped values;
- return credentials through a public domain service;
- capture complete HTTP requests/headers or provider payloads without explicit sanitization.

Prefer safe evidence such as `has_api_key: true`, provider name, operation, and domain IDs. If a thrown SDK error can
echo request headers/body, sanitize what is captured rather than assuming `cause` is safe to serialize.

## Service shape and ownership

Application/provider services should hide env names and credentials behind domain operations. Callers should not pass
API keys into every method or know which variable configures a provider. Config is a layer-construction concern;
dynamic tenant credentials are domain data and should be resolved securely inside the owning service, still represented
as `Redacted` until the adapter edge.

Expose both concrete options and `layerConfig(Config.Wrap<Options>)` only for reusable library-style modules. In app
code, prefer a small typed config service or loading directly inside the implementing layer—whichever keeps the public
domain service deepest and easiest to substitute.

## Failure and observability

Do not `orDie` config loading. Missing/malformed config should remain a typed startup failure with the config path,
captured by application startup observability if actionable. Do not "recover" a malformed secret by using an empty
string. Capture config failures without attaching provider trees or values that may contain credentials.

Review checklist:

- no service-logic `process.env`;
- required values have no misleading defaults;
- malformed values fail rather than falling through accidentally;
- all credentials remain `Redacted` to the final adapter call;
- telemetry contains only safe fields;
- tests inject `ConfigProvider`/typed config layers without global env mutation.
