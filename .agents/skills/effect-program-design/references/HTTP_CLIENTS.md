# HTTP Clients and Provider Adapters (Effect v4)

Use this reference for outgoing HTTP, provider adapters, response decoding, retries, and rate limits. Verify APIs and
imports against the project's installed Effect v4 declarations. HTTP remains unstable in v4:

```ts
import * as FetchHttpClient from "effect/unstable/http/FetchHttpClient";
import * as HttpClient from "effect/unstable/http/HttpClient";
import * as HttpClientError from "effect/unstable/http/HttpClientError";
import * as HttpClientRequest from "effect/unstable/http/HttpClientRequest";
import * as HttpClientResponse from "effect/unstable/http/HttpClientResponse";
```

The concrete fetch transport is `FetchHttpClient.layer`; do not use the older/nonexistent `HttpClient.layer`.

## Adapter boundary

A named adapter effect owns the entire boundary: build request, attach auth, execute, classify status, decode body,
map transport/status/decode failures to tagged errors, observe raw failures, and apply an idempotent retry policy.
Business services receive domain values and caller-actionable typed errors—not responses, status codes, JSON, or
`HttpClientError`.

Keep network calls outside database transactions. Declare the client service in `R`/yield it in the layer so tests
can replace the transport; do not call global `fetch` from domain logic.

## Configured client

Use transforms to configure a client once. Keep credentials `Redacted`; unwrap only while constructing the
authorization header at this adapter edge.

```ts
const makeProviderClient = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const client = yield* HttpClient.HttpClient;
  const apiKey = yield* Config.redacted("WIDGET_API_KEY");
  const baseUrl = yield* Config.url("WIDGET_API_BASE_URL");

  return client.pipe(
    HttpClient.mapRequest(HttpClientRequest.prependUrl(baseUrl.toString())),
    HttpClient.mapRequest(HttpClientRequest.bearerToken(Redacted.value(apiKey))),
    HttpClient.mapRequest(HttpClientRequest.acceptJson),
  );
});
```

Never log the configured request object if it can contain authorization headers/query credentials. Never put the
unwrapped key in errors, span attributes, error-report metadata, cache keys, or retry logs.

## Request, status, and decode

Pinned v4 provides client accessors/methods `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `del`, and `execute`; request helpers
include `bodyJson` and `schemaBodyJson`; response helpers include `filterStatusOk`, `schemaBodyJson`, `schemaJson`,
and `schemaNoBody`.

```ts
const listWidgets = (client: HttpClient.HttpClient) =>
  client.get("/v1/widgets").pipe(
    Effect.flatMap(HttpClientResponse.filterStatusOk),
    Effect.flatMap(HttpClientResponse.schemaBodyJson(WidgetsResponseSchema)),
    Effect.map((response) => response.widgets.map(toWidget)),
    Effect.mapError(mapHttpFailure),
    Effect.tapError((error) => captureProviderFailure(error, { operation: "list_widgets" })),
    Effect.withSpan("widget.api.list_widgets"),
  );
```

Check/classify status before decoding a success schema. If provider error bodies carry actionable codes, decode them
with a separate schema and convert them to internal tagged errors. Centralize raw error inspection in one adapter
mapper; do not scatter `instanceof`, `_tag` comparisons, status casts, or message matching through services.

The adapter should have a rich internal union such as token revoked / rate limited / unavailable / malformed
response. Capture it before the service narrows it to decisions such as needs reauth / unavailable. Include only safe
provider code, status, operation, request ID, and domain IDs in telemetry—not response bodies by default.

## Retry and rate limiting

Pinned v4 exposes:

- `HttpClient.retryTransient(...)` for common transient transport/timeouts and HTTP `408`, `429`, `500`, `502`,
  `503`, and `504` behavior.
- `HttpClient.withRateLimiter(...)` for proactive pacing and rate-limit header learning; it requires a `RateLimiter`
  and adds `RateLimiterError` to the channel.
- Operation-level `Effect.retry` for provider-payload/domain-specific typed retry policy.

Retries remain a domain decision. Apply them only to idempotent reads/deletes or writes protected by an idempotency
key/atomic claim, bound attempts with `Schedule.take`, add jitter, respect `Retry-After`, and leave exhaustion typed
and visible. Confirm retry semantics with the user. See `SCHEDULING_WORKERS.md`.

## Raw fetch exception

Raw `fetch` is acceptable at a deliberate browser/edge/platform/library boundary where unstable Effect HTTP is not
appropriate. Keep it in an adapter, wire the `AbortSignal` supplied by `Effect.tryPromise`, and preserve the same
status/decode/typed-error discipline.

```ts
const execute = Effect.tryPromise({
  try: (signal) => fetch(url, { signal, headers }),
  catch: (cause) => new ProviderTransportError({ operation: "request", cause }),
});
```

Do not consume a body twice. Parse unknown JSON through Schema at the boundary. Avoid capturing raw request/response
bodies because they may contain tokens or user data.

## Layers and tests

Production supplies the platform transport (for Node/fetch environments, typically `FetchHttpClient.layer`). Keep an
unprovided implementing layer for transport tests, then provide the transport only at application composition.
Tests should substitute a fake `HttpClient` layer or a loopback server—not mock `fetch`, spy on adapter methods, or
provide `undefined as never`.

Test transport failure, each meaningful status/provider code, malformed success JSON, cancellation/timeout, retry
count/idempotency key reuse, and that secrets are absent from logged/spanned fields.
